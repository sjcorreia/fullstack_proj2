# Portfolio Site

This Portfolio Site was built to display some of the topics covered in the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program.
The site was developed to contain links to other projects that I have developed and links to my profile on the Stackoverflow site.

## Source for the Portfolio Site

The HTML/CSS sources for this portfolio site can be found on my [github](https://github.com/sjcorreia/fullstack_nanodegree/tree/master/project2) page. 

## Displaying the Site

The user can either clone this repository or download a zipped folder of the contents. The user can view the `portfolio.html` site in her favorite browser to view the contents of my portfolio.

This site was tested using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. I have also simulated the display on various mobile devices, such as an iPhone 7, iPad, or a Nexus 5S, using Google Chrome's DevTools.
